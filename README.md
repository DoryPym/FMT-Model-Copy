# Overview
Firmament Model (FMT Model) is a part of [Firmament Autopilot](https://github.com/Firmament-Autopilot) project. It includes a simulation framework with algorithm libraries designed with MATLAB/Simulink.

> FMT Model is mainly developed and tested in **Matlab 2018b**, so it's strongly recommended to use this version. However, it's possible to open the project with higher matlab version, but that is not well tested.
